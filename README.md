# SVG DASHBOARD

NOTE: I'm not proficient in Django as of currently. Due to time constraints and a little bit of struggle, I was unable to implement all of the features mentioned in the brief. Instead, I just focused on working towards MVPs to show my flexibility to unfamiliar technologies. I'm hoping this serves as proof that I'm quick to adapt to new frameworks and technologies and remain flexible based on requirements.

## FRONTEND SETUP

1. Redirect to frontned folder
```
cd frontend
```

2. Execute frontend
```
npm run dev
```

## BACKEND

1. Redirect to backend folder
```
cd backend
```

2. Create a new python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

3. Load into the python virtual environment
```
# for macOS: source venv/bin/activate
# for Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Execute backend
```
python manage.py runserver
```
